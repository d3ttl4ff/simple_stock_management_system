# `StockFlow: Simple Stock Management System`

"`StockFlow`" is a simple stock management system built using `C#` and `MySQL`, designed to streamline stock recording and tracking processes in a warehouse or inventory management setting and to use the practices of Object Oriented Programming. This application is tailored for administrators to efficiently manage stock items, record transactions, and generate stock level reports.

## `Features`

### `User Authentication`
StockFlow prioritizes security by implementing user authentication. Upon launching the application, administrators are prompted to log in using their unique credentials. Only authorized administrators can access and utilize the system.

### `User-Friendly Interface`
The user interface is designed with ease of use in mind. It provides a clean and intuitive dashboard for quick access to key functionalities.

### `Stock Management`
1. **`Add Items`**: Administrators can add new stock items to the warehouse. Each item is described with relevant details, such as name, quantity, and other attributes.

2. **`Delete Items`**: Unnecessary or obsolete stock items can be easily removed from the inventory. This helps maintain an organized and up-to-date warehouse.

3. **`Update Items`**: Stock items can be updated with real-time data. Administrators can modify item quantities, descriptions, or any other relevant information as needed.

4. **`Add Quantity`**: When a new delivery is received, administrators can update the quantity of existing stock items to reflect the latest stock levels.

5. **`Remove Quantity`**: If stock items are taken from the warehouse, administrators can adjust the quantity accordingly to accurately represent the stock on hand.

### `Stock Transactions Log`
StockFlow maintains a comprehensive log of all stock-related transactions. Administrators can view this log to track changes, identify trends, and maintain transparency in stock management.

### `Stock Levels Reports`
Administrators have the ability to generate stock level reports. These reports provide a clear overview of the current stock status, helping with inventory planning and management.
